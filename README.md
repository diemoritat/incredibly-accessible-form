# The Incredibly Accessible Form

This is an attempt to show how to make a form as accessible as possible to assistive technology users, partially inspired by: https://github.com/gdkraus/accessible-modal-dialog. I know that there's a form in the modal demo, but I felt the need to make a "more complete" one, with more elements and a few more functionalities, all of them listed above. 

## Features

	1. Basic input fields with label, instructions and error feedback;
	2. Basic buttons with visual and textual guidance;
	3. Made in compliance with WAI-ARIA, WCAG;
	4. 

## Validation

This form was tested using the following configurations and tools:

	1. JAWS 17.0.2211 64-bit in //BROWSER TESTED// for Windows 10:
	2. VoiceOver
	3. ChromeVox 53.0.2779.0 in Chrome 51.0.2704.103 for Windows 10:
